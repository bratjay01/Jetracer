BACHELOR THESIS: TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS SELF  DRIVING CAR FEATURES USING NVIDIA JETSON  NANO AND JETRACER PRO AI KIT

# About


The main goal of our project is to
 implement self driving car features namely lane detection and following and
 obstacle avoidance using Python and its Machine learning and deep learning
 libraries as it is has a more simple and consistent environment with advanced
 AI/ML framework support. Our secondary objective would be to achieve ob
stacle avoidance using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and
 ROS (Robot Operating System) with the help of a prototype which is a 1:18
 model of standard car. We made use of NVIDIA JETSON NANO which is a
 high performance board enabled with deep learning and Artificial intelligence
 capabilities. We have implemented our first project objective, lane following
 and obstacle avoidance using Machine Learning and Deep Learning through
 Python and its libraries. The next goal of the project was to implement obstacle
 avoidance using ROS (Robot Operating System), for that we have implemented
 SLAM using Google Cartographer after a thorough comparison between a lot
 of SLAM implementation methods.
